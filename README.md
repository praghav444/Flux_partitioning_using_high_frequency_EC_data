This project describes three different approaches for carbon and water flux partitioning using high-frequency (10 Hz) Eddy Covariance data. Three different approaches include (1) Flux Variance Similarity (FVS), (2) Modified Relaxed Eddy Accumulation (MREA), and (3) a newly proposed Conditional Eddy-Covariance (CEC) method. We demonstrate partitioning in differently managed two native tallgrass prairie (warm season C4-dominated) pastures. Scripts also explain different corrections to be performed on raw data before attempting the flux partitioning..
